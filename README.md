## Introduction

Welcome to the Cipher Library! This project aims to provide a collection of encryption algorithms implemented in Python. Currently, the library supports the following ciphers:

- Caesar Cipher
- Vigen√®re Cipher
- Simple Substitution Cipher

## Usage

### Caesar Cipher

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the Caesar Cipher:

## Roadmap

We are planning to add more encryption algorithms to this library in the future. Here's what you can expect in upcoming releases:

- Atbash Cipher
- ROT13
- Rail Fence Cipher
- Playfair Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- Enigma Machine
- RSA Algorithm

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new features or find any issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Phase 2: Decryption Algorithms

In Phase 2 of this project, we will focus on implementing decryption algorithms to complement our existing encryption algorithms. Stay tuned for updates!
